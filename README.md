wp-shortcodes
=============

Shortcode Finder is a WordPress plugin that allows you to find which shortcodes have been installed in your WordPress site.

This plugin gives you a lookup table that lists out all shortcodes in your system, both on the admin side and user side of WordPress depending on which hook the author added the shortcode. In addition to the lookup table, users are given a button to add any shortcode when creating/editing a post/page.

Compatibility:
WordPress 4.0.0
WordPress 4.0.1
